# Radio Input 

This project is used as a example on the way to implement radio buttons
that behave as follow:

- no initial selection
- one option must be selected.

When no selection is done, a warning must be displayed.
This warning is hidden when one option is selected by user.

For the example, a reset button is provided to revert to initial state.
